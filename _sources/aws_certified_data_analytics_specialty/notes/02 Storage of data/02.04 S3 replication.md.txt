# What is it
it's the asynchronous replication of data between two buckets in the same region (SRR) or in two regions (CRR)

* to use replication, both source and destination buckets has to have enabled versioning.
* buckets can be in different AWS accounts
* copying is asynchronous
* proper IAM permissions is required
* only new objects are replicated (new after enabling replication). Existing objects can be replicated using S3 Batch Operation
* by default, delete marker are not replicated - you need to enable it on replication rule in additional replication options
* but **deletion of selected version is not being replicated** - only deletion markers are

# Types of S3 replication
CRR = Cross Region Replication
SRR = Same Region Replication

# Use cases
CRR
* compliance
* lower latency access (for users in different regions)
* replication across accounts

SRR
* log aggregation
* live replication between environments (prod/test/int)
