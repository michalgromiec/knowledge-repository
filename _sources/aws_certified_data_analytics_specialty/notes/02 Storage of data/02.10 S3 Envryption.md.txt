# Types of data at-rest-encryption in S3 data
You can store object in one bucket encypted by more than one key (one can be encrypted by KMS, one by client-side etc).
You can declare default encryption, which will be applied in case when you doesn't specify encryption for uploaded object. 
You can use bucket policy to force encryption on client uploads (protect from unencrypted uploads) or you can use default encryption to force encyption even ifuser tries to upload unencrypted data.

## SSE - Server-Side Encryption
### SSE-S3 Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys
Encryption using keys handled, managed and owned by AWS - client doesn't have access to this key.
Objects are encrypted server-side, encryption is AES-256.
Client must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256" to upload and download data from S3 bucket.

By using S3-Managed Key you are able to encrypt all your s3 data with one encryption key, the key is generated specific for your AWS account.

### SSE-KMS Server-Side Encryption with KMS Keys stored in AWS KMS
Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service). Client have full control over this key by using AWS KMS.
Objects are encrypted server-side, encryption is AES-256.
Client must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms" to upload and download data from S3 bucket.

You can also use key stored in KMS in one of other AWS account (as long as you have permission for it)

Limitations:
* kms limits - each time you upload/download data you are requesting KMS API (GenerateDataKey or Decrypt), KMS has own quota per second limits (from 5500 to 30000 req per second)

### SSE-C Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys
Encryption using keys fully managed by client, outside of AWS. AWS doesn't store the encryption key client provides.
Key is being send in request headers, https must be used.
Objects are encrypted server-side.
Client must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm":"AES256" and "x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key":"<base64-encoded-encryption-key>" to upload and download data from S3 bucket.

This option can be used only with AWS CLI, AWS SDK or Amazon S3 Rest API.

## Client-Side Encryption
Clients must encrypt/decrypt data themselves before sending/after retrieving data to Amazon S3.
Objects are encrypted client-side and stored encrypted in S3 bucket.

# Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
Data are encrypted in flight by using HTTPS connections.
