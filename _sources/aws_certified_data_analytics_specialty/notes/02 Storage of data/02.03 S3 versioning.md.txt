# What is it
* you can version your files in Amazon S3
* can be enabled at the bucket level
* after enabling, object uploaded to s3 bucket with the same key will have filled in version key (literals+numbers)
* all files put into s3 bucket before enable versioning will have null in version key
* you can't delete versioning - you can only suspend it, previous versions of objects won't be deleted automatically

# Why should I use this?
* protect agains unintended deletes
* easy rollback to previous version

# How to use
1. Enable versioning
2. Upload updated object
3. You can delete selected version (show versions tick has to be enabled in AWS GUI)
4. Deletion of objects can be undone, because deleted objects (not versions!) adds delete markers to then instead of physically delete.
   1. in practice - deletion of versioned object ads new version of object with empty content, so you can delete this version to recover object
