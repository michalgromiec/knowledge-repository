* amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates with latency 100-200ms
* s3 allows for 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5500 GET/HEAD operations per second per prefix (perfix = full path to file)


# How to improve S3 performance
## Multipart upload
* recommended for files > 100MB, required for files > 5GB
* in practice, big file is splitted and paralelly uploaded to S3, and when all of them are uploaded to S3, S3 concatenate them into one big file and store it like it was one big file
## S3 Transfer Acceleration
Increases transfer speed by transfering data to one of hundreds edge location using public internet, and therefore AWS copies data between regions by using very fast AWS private network
It is compatible with multi-part upload.
## S3 byte-range fetches
similar to multi-part upload, allows to get range of object (i.e. allows to get only head 50 bytes of object)
