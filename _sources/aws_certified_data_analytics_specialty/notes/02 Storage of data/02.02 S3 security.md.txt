# Types
## User-Based
selected AWS role can or cannot have permission for S3 bucket or path

## Resource-Based
* bucket policies - created at s3 bucket level, manages permissions for bucket
  * json-based policies
  * can be used to grant public access to the bucket (for all principals, this can't be done using user-based permissions)
  * can be used to cross-account access (all principals from other account)
* object access control list (ACL) - finer grain
* bucket access control list (ACL)

You have a permission for object if
* the user IAM permisions allow it **OR** the resource policy allows **AND** there is no explicit deny

## Encryption
by default, data are not encrypted at rest. You can enable encryption by purpose:
* Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)
* Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
* Server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service-managed keys (SSE-KMS)

## Block all public access
additional security layer which blocks public access for all objects (meaning only owner and user which directly granted permissions are allowed to see content of object)
by default, all s3 bucket blocks all public access
