# What is it
S3 differs between types of storage - you can have cheaper storage class with higher read latency (i.e. glacier for backups is very cheap, but you can read data from this class after few hours only...)

# Storage classes list
* S3 standard - general purpose
  * 99.99% availability
  * used for frequently accessed data
  * low latency and high throughput
  * use cases: bigdata analytics, mobile application
* S3 Standard-infrequent access (IA)
  * 99.9% availability
  * use cases: disaster recovery, backups
  * less frequent access, but requires rapid access when needed
  * lower cost than S3 standard - general purpose
* S3 One Zone-infrequent access (IA)
  * still high durability, data will be lost when availability zone is destroyed
  * 99.5% availability
  * use cases: secondary backup copies of on-premise data or data you can recreate
* S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
  * low-cost object storage for archiving backup
  * pricing include additional object retrieval cost
  * instant retrieval has millisecond retrieval
  * minimum storage duration of 90 days (you pay for 90 days even object is stored for less than 90 days)
* S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
  * formerly Amazon S3 Glacier
  * 3 flexibility:
    * expedited - 1 to 5 minutes
    * standard - 3 to 5 hours
    * bulk - 5 to 12 hours (object retrieval cost is free)
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  * 2 flexibilities:
    * standard - up to 12 hours
    * bulk - up to 48 hours
    * minimum storage duration - 180 days
* S3 Intelligent Tiering
  * move data based on monitoring of usage data
  * there are no retrieval charges in S3 intelligent-tiering, but you pay for monitoring (per number of objects monitored)

object can move between classes manually or by using S3 lifecycle rules

# Durability vs Availability
* durability - measures how sure you are that object you store in S3 won't be lossed in full, it's the same for all storage classes and it's 11 9's
* availability - measures how readily available a service is, it differs between storage classes
