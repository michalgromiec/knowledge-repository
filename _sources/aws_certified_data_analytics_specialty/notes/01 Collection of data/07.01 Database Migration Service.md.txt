# AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)
other option for collection of data, in practice for copy or move data from source to target

* quick and secure migration of database
* underneath, works using ec2 instance
* allows for **migrate database** from source (can be even on-premise) to AWS database
* supports both 
  * homogeneous (e.g. oracle to oracle) 
  * heterogeneous (e.g. oracle to aurora, mssql to aurora) migration
* allows for **continuous data replication** using CDC (change data capture)
* minimizes downtime - databases stay fully operational during the migration

## Available Sources
* on-premise and ec2 instances databases
* azure sql databases
* amazon rds
* amazon s3

## Available Targets
* on-premise and ec2 instance databases
* amazon rds
* amazon redshift
* amazon dynamodb
* amazon s3
* elasticsearch services
* **kinesis data streams**
* documentdb

So you can e.g. replicate on-premise sql server to kinesis data stream and process changes as stream of changes

## AWS Schema Conversion Tool
allow for converting database schema from one database engine to another

not needed to use when migrate database of the same db engine (homogeneous migration)

in other words - it translates one db engine to other

## Pricing model
* pay for EC2 on-demand instances that are run underneath the service
* all data transfer into DMS is free
* data transfered between DMS and RDBS in the same Availability Zone (AZ) is also free
* so in the end - pay for data transfered outside AZ, Region and AWS only
