# Database Migration Service (DMS)
other option for collection of data

* quick and secure migration of database
* underneath, works on ec2 instance
* allows for **migrate database** from source (can be even on-premise) to AWS database
* supports both 
  * homogeneous (oracle to oracle) 
  * heterogeneous (oracle to aurora, mssql to aurora) migration
* allows for **continuous data replication** using CDC (change data capture)
* minimizes downtime - databases stay fully operational during the migration
# Sources and targets
## Sources
* on-premise and ec2 instances databases
* azure sql databases
* amazon rds
* amazon s3

## Targets
* on-premise and ec2 instance databases
* amazon rds
* amazon redshift
* amazon dynamodb
* amazon s3
* elasticsearch services
* kinesis data streams
* documentdb

So you can i.e. replicate on-premise sql server to kinesis data stream and process changes as stream of changes

## AWS Schema Conversion Tool
converts database schema from one engine to another

not needed to use when migrate database of the same db engine

in other words - it translates one db engine to other

## Pricing model
* pay for on-demand instances that are run underneath the service
* all data transfer into DMS is free
* data transfered between DMS and RDBS in the same Availability Zone (AZ) is also free
* so in the end - pay for data transfered outside AZ, Region and AWS only
