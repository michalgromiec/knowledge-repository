# Types of data interfaces

1. Real time - immediate actions can be done based on data
   2. Kinesis Data Streams (KDS)
   3. Simple Queue Services (SQS)
   4. Internet of Things (IOT)
5. Near-real time - Reactive actions
   6. Kinesis Data Firehose (KDF)
   7. Database Migration Services
8. Batch - Historical Analysis
   9. Snowball
   10. Data Pipeline

# Glossary
* throughput = efficiency of stream, measured in data size per second
* latency = delay of storing data in stream, measured in milliseconds/seconds
* throughput vs latency tradeoff - you can decrease latency by decreasing batch size, but as a side-effect your throughput can be decreased
* hot shard / hot partition = case when one of the shard have much more data than the other ones (when stream contains unbalansed partition keys)
* throttle
