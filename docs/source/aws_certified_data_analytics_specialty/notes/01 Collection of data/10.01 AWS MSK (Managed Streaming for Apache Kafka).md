# What is it
Alternative to AWS Kinesis, it's a serverless, fully managed Apache Kafka on AWS

* allows to create, update and delete Kafka Clusters without taking care about kafka brokers nodes & zookeeper nodes (MSK do it for you)
* msk clusters are deployed in VPC, multi-az
* automatic recovery from common kafka failures
* data is stored on EBS (elastic block storage) volumes

msk allows you to create custom configurations for your clusters, i.e. allows you to increase maximum size of message (default=1MB)

# Security
* in-flight encryption using TLS between the brokers (kafka instances allowing replication)
* in-flight encryption using TLS between clients and brokers
* at-rest encryption for EBS volumes using KMS
* network security - authorize specific security groups
* authentication & Authorization - read/write to topics
  * authentication:
    * mutual tls
    * sasl/scram
    * iam access control
  * authorization:
    * iam access control
    * kafka acl's

# Monitoring
* basic monitoring
* enhanced monitoring
* topic-level monitoring
* prometheus
* broker log delivery (to kinesis data streams, s3 or cloudwatch logs)

# Costs
Kafka MSK clusters are paid by hour.

Additional costs:
* EBS (storage)
* data transfer

# MSK Connect
managed Kafka Connect workers on AWS (Kafka Connect = functionality which allows to retrieve data from source to kafka topic or put data from kafka topic to other location)

* auto-scalling capabilities for workers
* any kafka connector can be deployed to msk connect workers
* pricing: per worker per hour

# Serverless
you can run msk without managing the capacity
you just define your topics and your partitions and you can use kafka
security = iam access control for all clusters

# Differences vs Kinesis
* allows sending bigger objects than kinesis (1MB, hard limit)
* use topics and partitions - kinesis names them as data streams and shards
* has more difficult managing of topics - Kinesis allows for shards splitting & merging
* have an option to disable tls in-flight encryption (kinesis not)
* have more option for security (authentication/authorization)
* retention time - MSK has unlimited max (Kinesis data streams default max is 365 days)
* integration - Kinesis has lot of integration, in MSK you need to use 3rd party tools
