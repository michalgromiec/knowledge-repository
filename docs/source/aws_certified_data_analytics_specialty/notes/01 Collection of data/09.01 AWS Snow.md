# What is it
Set of highly secure, offline portable devices.

Used to:
* (mostly) migrate data into and out of AWS
  * snowcone
  * snowball edge
  * snowmobile
* collect and process data at the edge
  * snowcone
  * snowball edge

# Why it is used?
* sometimes it is faster/cheaper to move data physically instead of transfering data
* to not to block whole internet connection with data transfer

# Types of devices
## Snowball Edge
* physical data transport solution, move TBs or PBs to or from AWS
* alternative to moving data over the network
* pay per data transfer job
* two types of snowball edge devices:
  * storage optimized = 80TB of HDD capacity
  * compute optimized = 42TB of HDD capacity

## AWS Snowcone
* much smaller than snowball edge - 8TB
* secure, withstands harsh environments (i.e. desert)
* very light (2.1kg)
* 8TB of HDD capacity
* can be sent back to AWS offline or connect to internet and use AWS Datasync (i.e. when collecting data in environment with no internet connection, you can move it to your data center and connect to the internet there)

## AWS Snowmobile
* truck (car) which allows to transfer exabytes of data
* each snowmobile has 100PB of capacity
* highly secure, temperature controlled, gps, video surveilance

# Usage process
1. Request device from the AWS Console
2. install snowball client on your server
3. connect snowball and copy files
4. ship back to aws
5. data will be loaded into an s3 bucket
6. snowball is completely wiped

# Edge computing
process data while it's being created on an edge location (truck on the road, ship on the sea, mining area)
* location with limited access to internet or no easy access to computing power

You can setup snowball edge or snowcone to do edge computing

## use cases
* preprocess data
* machine learning at the edge
* transcoding media streams
* (eventually) ship back device to aws for transfering data

## types of devices
* snowcone
  * 2CPU, 4GB of RAM, usb-c power or optional battery
* snowball edge - compute optimized
  * 52vCPU, 208GB RAM, optional GPU, 42TB HDD
* snowball edge - storage optimized
  * up to 40vCPU, 80GB RAM, 80TB HDD

all of them can run ec2 instances & aws lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)

# AWS OpsHub
graphical interface for manage snow devices (previously there was only CLI option)
