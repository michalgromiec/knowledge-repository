# Cloudwatch Logs Subscription Filter
It is possible to move cloudwatch logs into one of solution:
* Kinesis Data Streams
* Kinesis Data Firehose
* AWS Lambda

## Kinesis Data Streams
Your data are put into kinesis stream, so you can e.g. write your own alarm solution based on your custom code. You can have more than one consumer consumes same data stream.

## Kinesis Firehose
You can write aggregation of your logs to S3, using builtin aws lambda transformation functionality.

## AWS Lambda
you can write your own processing code, you will achieve real time in this case, looks similar to kinesis data stream but you can have only one "point of processing" (whereas you can have more than one consumer attached to data stream)
