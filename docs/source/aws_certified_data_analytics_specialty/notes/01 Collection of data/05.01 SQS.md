# What is it
SQS is a Simple Queue Service.

You can have producers which write to queue and consumers reads from queue.

* AWS oldest offering (since first version)
* scales from 1 message/second to 10000 per second
* default retention = 4 days, maximum = 14 days, minimum = 1 minute
* extreme low latency (<10ms)
* no messages number limit
* you can add consumers to horizontally scalling solution
* can have duplicate messages (at-least-once-delivery)
* can have out of order messages (best effort ordering)
* limit of message size = 256KB maximum
* by default, sqs queue doesnt take into account order of messages (there is a new type of queue - fifo, which takes it into account)

# How to produce message
1. Define body (string, up to 256KB of size)
2. optionally add metadata (key-value attributes)
3. optionally provide delay delivery

SQS returns:
1. Message identifier
2. MD5 hash of the body

# How to consume message
1. application polls sqs for messages (receives up to 10 messages at a time)
2. application process messages within the visibility timeout
3. SQS delete message using message ID

# FIFO queue
* first-in-first-out
* guarantees order of messages
* lower throughput than the default queue (up to 3000 messages per second with batching or 300 mess/second without batching)
* name of the queue **must** end with `.fifo` suffix

# Visibility timeout
Describes amount of time after which message consumed by consumer and not deleted by consumer are back and available to other consumers. It begins when SQS return a message for consumer.
You should set the visibility timeout to the maximum amount of time that consumer needs to process and delete a message from the queue.
Default = 30 seconds, maximum = 12 hours

# Delivery Delay
Amout of time to delay delivery of message produced by producer to queue. In practce, message send to queue remains invisible to consumers for this duration.
Default = 0 seconds, maximum = 15 minutes

# Receive message wait time
You can delay queue polling processes to reduce the costs. Setting this option helps in getting more items in one request (up to 10 messages) and it eliminates number of empty responses. If a reveive request collects the maximum number of messages, it doesn't wait for the polling to timeout, it returns batch of results immediately.
Default = 0 seconds, maximum = 20 seconds.

# Dead-letter queues
You can rewrite messages which can't be consumed succesfully to separate queue which is called dead-letter queue. Dead-letter queue is not created automatically, you have to create it by yourself. Dead-letter queue type (standard/fifo) must match the source queue.
Message is sent to dead-letter queue when Maximum receive values is exceeded. If the ReceiveCount exceeds this threshold (set up on creating the queue), message is sent do dead-letter queue.
Dead-letter queue must exist within the same AWS account and resides in the same region as the source queue.

# SQS extended client
* allows for processing objects bigger than 256KB of size
* producer puts object into S3 and add only small metadata message to SQS queue, consumer receives metadata and retrieve large object from S3
* helpful, but not recommended (long time of processing such big objects)

# Use cases
* decouple applications (allow application to be asynchronous)
* buffer writes to database
* handle large loads of messages comming in (for example on peaks for database writes)

# Pricing
* pay per api request and per network usage

# Security
* encryption in flight by using https endpoints
* encryption at rest by using server side enctyption using KMS
* iam policy must allow usage of sqs in general
* sqs queue access policy can verify if certain role can access to certain queue
  * controlled over IP
  * controlled over the time the requests come in

# Differences to Kinesis
1. Message body is string, Kinesis have bytes
2. Message size limit is 256KB, Kinesis has 1MB
3. As consumers deletes messages when processing done, one SQS message cannot be processed by more than one application, Kinesis doesn't delete messages so one kinesis stream message can be processed by more than one application or processed more than once
4. So in general, data can be consumed once, in Kinesis they can be deleted many times
5. and in general, allows for multiple applcations reading from one stream (pub-sub architecture)
6. SQS deletes messages when processed by consumer, Kinesis delete only after the retention period
7. SQS by default doesnt pay attention on messages order, Kinesis store messages in shards ordered by incoming timestamp
8. SQS doesnt have option for checkpointing to store where application finished reading
9. SQS have one pricing option similar to kinesis provisioned, kinesis has provisioned/on-demand mode

In general, we can recognize below use-cases:
## SQS use cases
* processing objects
* application decoupling
## Kinesis Data Streams use cases:
* fast data collection and processing
* data capture
* real time data analytics
* complex stream processing

# How to...

## Send message to queue
```bash
aws sqs send-message --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --message-body "testowy" --profile mg-priv
```

## Retrieve message from queue
Default function, which retrieves one message from queue:
```bash
aws sqs receive-message --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --profile mg-priv
```
By using max-number-of-messages parameter you can retrieve up to 10 messages in one request
```bash
aws sqs receive-message --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --max-number-of-messages 10 --profile mg-priv
```

## Delete message from queue
To delete one selected message:
```bash
aws sqs delete-message --receipt-handle AQEBUjqhol2b6R0OzsWBtONbDhk8wVlnU4bRJsUOnHIorUZZijTXydsOSBKI2+D4MVoPApMp+Dm8Y6T77IwNJan001/wS0GEpMg6eemDnj7IcuiGFlEc1M64YzuqMyirbdPb6ZsDucfethSAxzu7QsIqHjb0L9y9ePUBnDi1JFNHtgUlzRYMUdroP9QaQebAsaSoPkbUmXKqxheAq9EkNDrYN6AYZ8T1VPzpM0Gn/fU7HVMl+40PTwY21hk7H5dWYoE5xd21ug3i8HycxMIfy/2YRE46MmEYJSmK0bPqYJj+7E/Kq/R/UklnTNrIpdlfbojUDcXoo/sBOWrZv57NQ8NyPgiWkfZttqgsrOUvVirLkV+VyrvXQlKmOG/M0tA3Rd0364lCLmWJU/8SvraJM0zKng== --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg
```

You can also delete messages in batch:
```bash
aws sqs delete-message-batch --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --entries '[{"Id":"msg1","ReceiptHandle":"abc123"},{"Id":"msg2","ReceiptHandle":"def456"}]'
```

## Manually move message to dead-letter queue
There is no direct option for moving message to dead-letter queue. What you could do is:

1. Receive message data
2. Manually put message to dead-letter queue by using aws sqs send-message
3. Delete message from source queue

## Get number of messages in queue
You can retrieve **approximate** number of messages waiting for consumption in queue. Approximate because at the end SQS uses a distribute system to process messages, so the actual number of messages in the queue may differ from this number
```bash
aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages --profile mg-priv
```

## Get number of processed messages for queue
It is not possible to get it directly from SQS - this service is only for distribution of messages so it doesn't store number of processed messages anywhere.

## Get data of oldest and the newest message in queue

## Check if message is present in queue (based on body)

## Get number of processing time of waiting messages and calculate histogram

## Get how many times message were consumed by consumers (tries)
There is no direct command to retrieve this number, however it is possible to retrieve message and include this number as an attributes of the response
```bash
aws sqs receive-message --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --attribute-names All --profile mg-priv
```

## Get all queue attributes in one request
```bash
aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --attribute-names All
```

## Purge queues
```bash
aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/662419442876/test-queue-mg --profile mg-priv
```
