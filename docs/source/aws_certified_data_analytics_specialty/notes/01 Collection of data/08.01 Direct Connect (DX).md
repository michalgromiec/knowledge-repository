# What is it
allows for direct connection between on-premise environment and aws resources

communication is faster because your local on-premise environment communicate with public resources not via internet but via direct connect.

# Connection Types
* dedicated - 1, 10 or 100 gbps capacity
  * physical ethernet port dedicated to a customer
  * request made to aws first, than completed by aws direct connect
* hosted - 50mbps, 500mbps up to 10gbps
  * request made via aws direct connect partners
  * capacity can be added or removed on demand

# Lead times
often longer than 1 month to establish a new connection

# Encryption
* data is not encypted, but is private
* to encrypt, use VPN to provide an ipsec-encypted private connection

# Resiliency
You can have two on-premise environments and connect them using two aws direct connect services
to have maximum resilliency, you have to have separate connections terminating on separate devices in more than one location (more than one connection for each location)
