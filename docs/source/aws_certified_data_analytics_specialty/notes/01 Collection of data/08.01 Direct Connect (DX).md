# AWS Direct Connect (DX)
allows for direct connection between on-premise environment and aws resources

communication is faster because your local on-premise environment communicate with AWS resources not via internet but via direct connect.

## Connection Types
* dedicated - 1, 10 or 100 gbps capacity
  * physical ethernet port dedicated to a customer
  * request made to aws first, then completed by aws direct connect
* hosted - 50mbps, 500mbps up to 10gbps
  * request made via aws direct connect partners
  * capacity can be added or removed on demand

## Lead times
often longer than 1 month to establish a new connection

## Encryption
* data is not encrypted, but connection is private (like with VPC Endpoints)
* to encrypt, use VPN to provide an ipsec-encrypted private connection

## Resiliency
You can have two on-premise environments and connect them using two aws direct connect services to have maximum resiliency, you have to have separate connections terminating on separate devices in more than one location (more than one connection for each location)

# Pricing model
* pay per GB of data transfer OUT (from 0.02$ to 0.19$ per GB)
* pay per port hours (hours of connection usage, depend on speed of connection, e.g. 0.30$ per hour of 1Gbps, 2.25$ per hour of 10Gbps of dedicated connections)
