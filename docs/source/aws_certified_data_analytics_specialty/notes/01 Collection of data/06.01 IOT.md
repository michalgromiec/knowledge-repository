# AWS IOT
IoT services, internet of things

* deployed as IoT Thing (thermostat, car, lightbulb etc, connected device)
* IoT thing is being registered in Thing Registry
  * each device gets unique ID
  * supports metadata for each device
  * allows to group devices and apply permission
* thing communicates with cloud via Device gateway (it's a level of communication between IoT things)
  * Things can be not-connected and visible to each other, but they can communicate through Device Gateway (i.e. controller can send command to gateway and gateway processes command and make an action to other IoT thing)
* Device Gateway have own API which allows to communicate with all IoT Things
* thing produce data via IoT Message Broker
* IoT Message Broker 
  * supports pub/sub messaging pattern
  * devices can communicate via broker despite lack of direct communication between them
  * messages send using MQtt, websockets or http
  * reroute messages to one of below:
    * IoT Rules Engine
      * can redirect message i.e. to kinesis data stream, sqs, lambda
      * can process message and make an action based on this message
      * can generate many actions based on one incomming messages
      * can generate different set of actions based on incomming message (i.e. for stop device can send comand stop device to iot thing, but it can also log action in dynamodb or s3 bucket)
        * it allows for not running lambda directly by iot thing - all possible interfaces are stored in rules engine
    * Device Shadow (shadow of the device)
      * virtual copy of iot thing
      * allows us to store state of target iot thing if target iot thing is not available - it will sync states with this iot thing when iot thing will be available back
* fully serverless and scales automatically

## AWS Services
there is a seperate service group called Internet of Things, but for the exam there is no need to know all of them.
