# AWS Lambda

Serverless service which allow you to run programmatic code without managing servers, with pay-as-you-use pricing option

## Lambda events
every lambda function can be trigger by event. THis event is input parameter for lambda function which also supplies some information about events as parameters, so you can utilize facts/data about this event inside Lambda funcition code.

Next Lambda function do some processing and return another event or destination (by returning another event lambda pipelines is allowed)

Most useful events examples in scope of Big Data:
* S3 - new objects put to S3
* DynamoDB - new row
* Kinesis Streams
* Kinesis Firehose - allow for transforming data put into firehose
* Redshift
* IoT
* Elasticsearch
* Data Pipeline
* many others out of scope for big data environments

## Use cases
* real time log processing (combine lambda and kinesis firehose)
* etl pipeline (when data comes to S3, run some process...)
* cron jobs (daily batch jobs, weekly batches etc)

## Limitations
* execution time limit = 15 minutes (900 seconds), hard limit
* request and response payload = 6MB (synchronous) and 256KB (asynchronous)
* 3GB of memory RAM
* 1000 concurrent executions (soft limit, can be increased by AWS support)
