# What is it
dynamodb table stream is the list of all modifications made to dynamodb table.

so as an effect it is something like change log for all items and it can be:
* sent to kinesis data streams
* sent to lambda
* read by kinesis client library applications

Data Retention is up to 24 hours

You can choose what data will be send to target:
* KEYS_ONLY - only the key attributes of the modified item
* NEW_IMAGE - entire item after changes
* OLD_IMAGE - entire item before changes
* NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - both entire items before and after changes

dynamodb streams are very similar to kinesis - ie. is made of shards.

stream is populated with changes made only after stream has been enabled (can't create list of historical changes) 

# Use Cases
* notification for users (i.e. lambda verifying changes on dynamodb table and sending mail, or SES on SNS on kinesis data stream)
* analytics (firehose on top on kinesis stream and archiving data in amazon s3)
* workaround for triggers (lambda inserts data into other tables based on changes in main table)
