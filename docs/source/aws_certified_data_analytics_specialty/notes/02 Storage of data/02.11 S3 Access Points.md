# What is it
It's kind of "shortcut" for prefix in S3 bucket - each access point gets its own DNS endpoint and authorization policy.

It can contain one or more prefixes from certain S3 bucket.

# Object Lambda
Lets say we have two types of users which should be able to read some data from S3 bucket. One of them can see raw data, but the other one should see redacted data, let's say with deleted personal data (surnames)

To do this, we can implement access point for one of the group and implement on this access point S3 Object Lambda function.
This function is being executed on each object retrieved by user.

That way we do not have two version of the same data - we store raw data and redact/modify responses for certain group of users.

Same process can be used also for enrich data (e.g. add other data for retrieved data)
