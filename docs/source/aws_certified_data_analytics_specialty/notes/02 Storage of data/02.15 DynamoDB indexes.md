# Types of indexes
## Local Secondary Index (LSI)
* alternative sort key for table, primary key stay the same
* consist of one scalar attribute (string,number,binary)
* table can have up to 5 LSIs
* must be defined at table creation time (even though attribute is not visible - )
* attribute projections - results can contain some or all attributes of the table, but also ca contain keys only, so you can retrieve keys only and send next getitem request for selected keys

## Global Secondary Index (GSI)
* alternative primary key
* speed up queries on non-key attributes
* must provision separate RCUs & WCUs for the index
* allows to query data by non-primary-key attribute (yet still data are the same and are returned as it would be basic table)
* can be added/modified after the table creation

## Indexes impact on main table throttle
* GSI
  * **if the writes are throthled on the GSI, the main table will be throttled also** (even if the WCU on the main table are fine)
* LSI
  * uses main table RCUs/WCUs, so no special impact on throthling
