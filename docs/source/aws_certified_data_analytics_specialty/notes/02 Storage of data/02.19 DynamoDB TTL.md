# What is it
TTL = Time To Live, automatically delete items after an expiry timestamp

* doesn't consume any WCU
* in practice, you need to have attribute which will contain epoch timestamp of item expiration timestamp and select this attribute in table Time To Live configuration
* expired items are deleted within maximum 48 hours
* expired but not yet deleted items still appears in query results (has to be excluded manually using filters)
* items are dropped also from LSI and GSI and operation is also visible in stream
* use case: session data
