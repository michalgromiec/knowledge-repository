# Consistency
## Eventually Consistent Read
reads data no matter if replicated in full between DynamoDB replicas server (underneath, not visible for users)

```{note}
One Eventually Consistent Read consumes half of the RCU
```
## Strongly Consistent Read
reads only those data which are replicated in full between replicas server
 
# DynamoDB partitions internal
* when you write item to dynamodb, dynamodb calculates hash for primary key of written item and based on hash function result decide to which partition record will be written
* hot partition = partition for which the most items are written (mostly because of primary key, not because of hashing function)
* number of partitions depends on provisioned throughput and the size of the items in the table
  * the larger provisioned throughput or rager items in table = the more partitions dymanodb creates to store the data
  * number of partitions is higher number of two below numbers:
    * RCU_total/3000 + WCU_total/1000
    * table_size_total/10GB
* dynamodb automatically scales the number of partitions to meet the capacity requirements
* when number of partitions change, data in the table is redistributed across the new partitions (process known as partition split). The aim is to evenly distribute data across the partitions, to encure the highest performance of the table
* parition split can result on increased read and write lantecies (yet it doesn't consume capacity units, it's a background process)

# Capacity modes
There are two modes of capacity/throughput, you can switch between then once every 24 hours 

## Provision Mode
* default (10RCU/10WCU)
* specify the number of reads/writes per seconds
* need to plan capacity beforehand
* pay for **provision** (not only used) read & write capacity units
* option to setup autoscaling of throughput to meet demand (specify minimum and maximum capacity units and target utilization - required capacity units number is calculated based on target utilization percentage)
* limits can be exceeded temporarily using **Burst Capacity**
* if Burst Capacity consumed, `ProvisionedThroughtputExceededException` is raised - in this case retry is needed to store/read data
## On-Demand Mode
* automatically scale read/writes
* no capacity planning
* pay for what you use, more often more expensive
* no throttle - pay for everything you want to do
* you are charged for reads/writes that you use in terms of RRU Read Request Units/WRU Write Request Units (RRU = RCU, WRU = WCU)
* 2.5x more expensive than provisioned capacity
* use cases: 
  * unknown workloads, 
  * unpredictable application traffic,
  * quick data migration on start (very high number of writes in short time - you dont need to set very high WCU capacity for 24 hours)

# Capacity Units
## Read Capacity Units - throughput for reads
* 1 RCU = 1 strongly consistent read or 2 eventually consistent reads per second for an item up to 4KB in size
* example = 7 strongly consistent read per second, each 2.7KB in size = 7 * ROUNDUP(2.7/4) = 7RCU
* example = 11 eventually consistent  reads per second for an item 3.7KB in size = 11/2 * ROUNDUP(3.7/4) = 5.5RCU
## Write Capacity Units - throughput for writes
* 1 WCU = 1 write per second for an item up to 1KB in size
* items larger than 1KB, more WCUs are consumed
* example = 7 items per second, each 2.7KB in size => 7*ROUNDUP(2.7/1) = 21WCU
* ```{warning}delete operations on nonexistent items consumes one write capacity unit```
