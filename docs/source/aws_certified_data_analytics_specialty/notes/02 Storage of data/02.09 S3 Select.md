# What is it

It's a mechanism of filtering data on AWS server side.

By using simple SQL statements you can filter object data and retrieve only this part of data which you are interested in.

Amazon S3 Select works on objects stored in CSV, JSON, or Apache Parquet format. It also works with objects that are compressed with GZIP or BZIP2 (for CSV and JSON objects only), and server-side encrypted objects. You can specify the format of the results as either CSV or JSON, and you can determine how the records in the result are delimited.
