# BLOBs (Large Objects Pattern)
one example of interface with S3 is when your item contains blob greater then maximum dynamodb item size.

In such case - you uploads blob to s3 and store in dynamodb table url to this object.

# Indexing S3 Objects Metadata
1. application upload object to S3 bucket
2. bucket event notification invokes lambda, which stores object metadata (size, dates, who created) in dynamodb
3. application can query dynamodb to retrieve only metadata of objects
3b.client can have access to metaata only, without access to s3
3c.client can query objects by metadata easily (i.e. by partiql queries)
