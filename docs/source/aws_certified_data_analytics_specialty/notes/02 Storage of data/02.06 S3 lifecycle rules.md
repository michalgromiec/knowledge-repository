# What is it
You can automate moving objects between storage classes using **lifecycle rules**

# Lifecycle rules types

## Transition Actions
move objects from one storage class to another, examples:
* move objects from one zone to another n days after creation
* move to glacier for archiving after 6 months after creation

## Expiration actions
delete objects, examples:
* delete access log files after 365 days
* delete old versions of files
* delete incomplete multi-part uploads

# Actions types
* move current versions between storage classes
* move noncurrent versions between storage classes (history of changes of objects)
* expire current versions of objects (soft-delete when versioning is enabled or hard-delete when versioning is not enabled)
* permanently delete noncurrent versions of objects (hard-delete)

# Comments
* rule can be created for a certain prefix (but can't be created for suffixes or glob/regex expressions)
* rule can be created for certain object Tags

# S3 Analytics
you can create csv report with some recommendations on age of your object. Report is updated daily by AWS.
