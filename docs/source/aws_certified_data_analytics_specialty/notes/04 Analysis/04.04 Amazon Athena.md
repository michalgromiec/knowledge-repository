# Amazon Athena
query engine for doing interactive queries of S3 data

## What is it
* completely serverless (pay for scanned data)
* interactive query service for S3 (data stays at S3, Athena give only interface and optimizer for this data)
* under the hood - Presto
* supports many ddata formats
  * CSV
  * JSON
  * ORC (columnar, splittable)
  * Parquet (columnar, splittable)
  * Avro (splittable)
* can read unstructured, semi-structured or structured data
* works with Glue Data Catalog

## Use cases
* ad-hoc queries of web logs
* querying staging data before loading to redshift
* analyze cloudtrail/cloudfront logs in S3
* integration with Jupyter/Zeppelin/RStudion notebooks
* integration with QuickSight
* integration via ODBC/JDBC with other visualization tools

## Integration with AWS Glue
* uses AWS Glue Data Catalog by default (it is possible to add other data source by using Lambda's functions, supported heavily by AWS GUI)
* Athena is based on Presto, so it doesn't contain table schemas directly - it uses external data sources, in this example - Hive metastore which is in this definition AWS Glue Meta Store

## Workgroups
* can organize users/teams/apps into Workgroups
* you can control query access and track costs by Workgroup
* integrates with IAM/Cloudwatch/SNS
* workgroups have its own separate:
  * query history (via S3 path set for query history)
  * data limits (limit how much data queries may scan by workgroup)
  * IAM policies
  * Encryption settings

## Pricing model
* pay as you go
* $5 per TB scanned
* succesful or cancelled queries count, failed queries do not
* all DDL operations are free (CREATE/ALTER/DROP)
* you can save lots of money by using columnar formats (ORC/Parquet, by allowing athena to query only necessary columns not all data and by reucing size of column by columnar storage)
* schema partitioning also reduce size of scanned data

## Security
* access control by IAM (access to athena, read from S3) and S3 bucket policies (permissions for certain path in S3 bucket)
* encrypt results at rest in S3 staging directory
  * SSE-S3, SSE-KMS and CSE-KMS (being honest, it's an option for S3 not directly for Athena)
* in-transit secured by TLS (HTTPS), also between Athena and S3

## Anti-patterns
* visualization, highly formatted reports
* ETL - use Glue instead, EMR with Apache Spark

## Performance optimization
* use columnar data
* small number of large files performs better than large number of small files
* use partitions

## ACID transactions
* powered by Apache Iceberg (just add `table_type='ICEBERG` in TBLPROPERTIES of CREATE TABLE command)
* compatible with EMR/Spark and any other tool supporting Iceberg table format
* implement record locking (to prevent from changing data when more than one user modifies record in the same moment)
* allows for time travel operations
  * user is able to revoer data recently deleted
* need to manual optimize table to prevent from degrade performance of table (by using `OPTIMIZE` command)
