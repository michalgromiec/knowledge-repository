# What is it
* EMR = Elastic Map Reduce
* Managed Hadoop framework run on EC2 instances (AWS implement Hadoop to automate set up using AWS EC2 instances)
* includes Spark/Hbase/Presto/Flink/Hive & more, depends on EMR cluster version
* includes EMR Notebooks
* integrated with other AWS services (e.g. AWS Glue metastore)

# EMR Cluster
* collection of EC2 instances (node)
* types of nodes:
  * master - manages the cluster, tracks status of tasks, "leader node", can runs tasks
  * core node - hosts HDFS data and runs tasks
  * task node - runs tasks, doesnt host data, use when you dont need local HDFS datastore, if you have data on S3 bucket, good use of spot instances because doesn't contain data and there is no risk of data loss itself
* it is possible to create single node cluster composed of master node only
* like in every hadoop cluster, tasks will be executed by core and task nodes (and optionally by master node)

# Cluster types based on usage
* transient cluster
  * automatically terminates once all steps are complete
  * exists only for the duration of steps processing
  * costs reduction
* long-running clusters
  * terminated manually
  * best for data warehouse with periodic processing on large datasets (to reduce bootstrapping time for every process)
  * can use reserved instances on long-running clusters to save money

# EMR usage
* applications and their versions are selected at cluster creation
* user connects directly to master node to run jobs directly
* user can submit steps by using AWS Console
* user can also use Jupyter Notebooks and use EMR cluster

# EMR integration with other AWS services
* EC2 = uses EC2 instances for nodes
* VPC = nodes uses virtual network
* S3 = store input and output data, not need to use HDFS filesystem in EMR cluster
* Cloudwatch = monitor cluter performance
* IAM = store permission to EMR cluster
* CloudTrail = audit requrests made to the service
* Data Pipeline = schedule and start clusters

# EMR storage types
* HDFS = simple Hadoop Filesystem
  * data stored on core nodes of EMR cluster
  * ephemeral - data is lost when cluster is terminated
  * as in a standadrd HDFS implementation - data stored in blocks, redundant stored in core nodes
  * data locality can be used - dadta are processed directly on node where they exists (can be faster than S3 bucket data)
* EMRFS = EMR file system
  * access S3 as if it were HDFS
  * persistent storage, preserve also after cluster termination
* Local file system
  * ephemeral
  * suitable only for temporary data (buffers, caches)
* EBS for HDFS
  * elastic block storage
  * ephemeral

# Pricing model
* separate price for EMR, beyond this EC2 costs so you have to pay for them
* user can add or remove task node anytime on the fly
* user can change code nodes number, but removing those core came with risk of data loss (hdfs stores data there, it should be done using hadoop nodes redundancy, but still it is risky when more than one code node is removed)
* you can temporarily improve EMR cluster efficiency by adding task nodes (or reduce it)

# EMR scaling
## Automatic scaling
Before 2020, the only option of scaling cluster was EMR Automatic Scaling.
EMR cluster capacity was changed based on cloudwatch metrics.
It was limited to instance groups only (only instances from same instance groups could be added)

## Managed scaling
Introduced in 2020. 
It allows specify minimum and maximum number of units which are taken into account when cluster resize is needed.

# EMR Serverless
It's an option for creating EMR jobs but without bootstraping and defining EMR cluster (and using EC2 underthehood).
It means you dont manage EMR cluster and AWS decide how many nodes with what power should be used to process your data.

You need to use EMR studio to use this service.

You can still specify default worker size & pre-initialized capacity, otherwise capacity used will be defined automatically

The most advantage is you dont have to define how many nodes, memory you need - it is calculated automatically.

**BUT** it is not a serveless like e.g. Athena - you still manage with create application, delete application etc.
