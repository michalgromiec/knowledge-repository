# AWS S3 encryption

## SSE-S3
* objects encrypted using keys handled&managed by AWS
* uses AES-256 encryption type
* client must set header `"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"`

## SSE-KMS
* objects encrypted using AWS Key Management Service
* objects encrypted using KMS Customer Master Key
* gives users permission control of who can use key and audit trail of key usage
* client must set header `"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"`

## SSE-C
* objects encrypted by keys provided by client
* amazon S3 does not store the encryption key - key is attached by the user in request headers, for every HTTP request (both POST and GET)
* HTTPS must be used
* user must be able to recognize what key has been used to object to be able to decrypt downloaded data, AWS doesnt store any information about which key has been used to encrypt object

## Client Side Encryption
* objects encrypted outside AWS, on client side (Amazon S3 Encryption Client)
* some AWS client helps in encrypt/decrypt process
