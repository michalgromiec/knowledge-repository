# AWS Services Security

## Kinesis
### Kinesis Data Streams
* SSL for in-flight encryption
* KMS provides encryption at rest
* client-side encryption is possible, by only by using own encryption libraries
* can be setup to access privately (VPC Endpoints/Private Link)

### Kinesis Data Firehose
* firehose needs IAM role to deliver data to target (S3/Redshift etc)
* KMS provide encryption at rest
* client-side encryption is possible, by only by using own encryption libraries
* SSL for in-flight encryption (communication between firehose and targets)

### Kinesis Analytics
* firehose needs IAM role to get data from sources and to deliver data to target (S3/Redshift etc)
* as it's only an ETL tool which communicate with external sources and targets, it doesn't need to implement any encryption by itself

## SQS
* SSL for in-flight encryption
* KMS provides encryption at rest
* IAM policy must allow usage of SQS
* SQS queue access policy (user have access to SQS queue)
* client-side encryption must be inplemented manually
* VPC endpoint is provide through interface

## IOT
* AWS IoT policies (like IAM policies)
* IAM policies for authorization
* Rules Engine has to have proper IAM role with access to target/source

## S3
* IAM policies with user access to functionalities
* S3 bucket policies (access from s3 point of view)
* Access Control Lists (ACLs)
* SSL for in-flight encryption
* Encryption at rest
  * SSE-S3 (server-side using AWS S3 key)
  * SSE-KMS (server-side using KMS key)
  * SSE-C (server-side using customer key)
  * Client-side encryption (client-side)
* possible versioning + MFA delete
* CORS for protecting websites
* VPC endpoint possible through Gateway

## DynamoDB
* SSL for in-flight encryption
* Encryption at rest
  * KMS encryption for base tables and econdary indexes
    * AWS owned key
    * AWS managed key (aws/dynamodb)
    * AWS customer managed key
* IAM roles for users authorization
* VPC endpoint possible through Gateway

## RDS
* VPC network isolation (by default, accessible only for instances within the same VPC)
* security groups control access at network level
* KMS provides encryption at rest
* SSL for in-flight encryption (for JDBC connection)
* IAM policies guarantees access to RDS API
* IAM authentication supported by PostgresSQL and MySQL
* authorization managed within the database

## Aurora
* similar to RDS
* VPC network isolation (by default, accessible only for instances within the same VPC)
* security groups control access at network level
* KMS provides encryption at rest
* SSL for in-flight encryption (for JDBC connection)
* IAM policies guarantees access to RDS API
* IAM authentication supported by PostgresSQL and MySQL
* authorization managed within the database

## Lambda
* IAM role attached to Lambda has own IAM policies attached (access to sources and targets)
* integrated KMS encryption for secrets
* SSM parameter store for configurations is possible
* integrated with CloudWatch logs
* deploy in VPC to access private resources

## Glue
* IAM policies control user level of permission
* Data Catalog
  * encrypted by KMS
  * resource policies to protect data catalog resources (similar to S3 bucket policy) - so you can restrict permissions to Glue Metastore objects
* connection passwords encrypted by KMS

## EMR
* possible manage of EC2 key pair for SSH credentials
* EMR has attached IAM role to EC2 instances for
  * proper S3 access
  * for EMRFS requests to S3
  * dynamodb scans through Hive
* security groups can secure access to nodes at network level
  * one for master node
  * another one for core nodes or task nodes
* Kerberos Authentication (provide authentication from Active Directory)
* finally you can setup Apache Ranger with Centralized Authorization (RBAC - Role Based Access) on separate EC2 and connect EMR to this service
* at-rest data encryption for EMRFS
  * Amazon S3 encryption (SSE-C is not supported by EMRFS)
* encryption in local disks of nodes
  * open-source HDFS encryption (builtin in Hadoop ecosystem)
  * EC2 instance store encryption (storage physically attached to EC2)
    * NVMe encryption
    * LUKS encryption
  * EBS volumes (attached through the network to EC2 instance)
    * EBS envryption using KMS (works with root volume)
    * LUKS envryption (does not work with root volume)
* in-transit encryption
  * node to node communication
  * TLS encryption for EMRFS traffic between S3 and cluter nodes

## ElasticSearch
* deployed in VPC so provide network isolation
* elasticsearch policy to manage security further (based on IP for example)
* at-rest data encryption using KMS
* in-flight encryption using SSL
* authorization secured by IAM or Cognito

## Redshift
* deployed in VPC so provide network isolation
* cluster security groups (network level security)
* in-flight encryption using JDBC driver enabled with SSL
* at-rest encryption using KMS or HSM device
* support S3 SSE using default managed key
* can reference IAM role when COPY or UNLOAD command is issued or pass directly access key and secret key

## Athena
* IAM policies control access to service
* data is is S3 (so S3 security takes place)
* in-transit encryption using TLS between Athena and S3 and JDBC
* fine grained access using AWS Glue Catalog

## Quicksight
* Authentication via
  * IAM users
  * Email based accounts
  * for enterprise eidtion additionally: active directory, federated login MFA, encryption at rest and in Spice
