# Encryption basics

## Encryption in-flight
* TLS/SSL (TLS is the newer version of SSL)
* data are encrypted before sending and encrypted after receiving
* communication between client and server or server and server
* encryption is done by using tls certificates
* ensures no "man in the middle" (MITM) attack is possible - so other user see only encrypted network data and can't see raw messages

### Step by step
1. source want to send object to the server
2. at the source side, object is encrypted using TLS certificate
3. object in encrypted form is send to target
4. target receives encrypted object and decrypt it using TLS certificate
5. target is able to see decrypted object 

## Server-side encryption at rest
* data is encrypted after received by the server and decrypted before sent to the client
* data is encrypted using the key
* keys must be managed somewhere and server must have access to key

### Step by step
1. client send object to the server (preferably using encryption in-transit, HTTPS)
2. server receives object and decrypt it using TLS certificate (in case HTTPS has been used)
3. server encrypts data using key known by the server
4. server stores encrypted object in encrypted form
5. when client want to download object, server decrypt object using key known by the server and send decrypted object to client (preferably using encryption in-transit, HTTPS)
6. client receives object and decrypt them using TLS certificate (in case HTTPS has been used)
7. client is able to see decrypted object

## Client-side encryption
* data is encrypted before sending and encrypted after receiving, but **only on the client side**
* server should not be able to decrypt the data
* used when we do not trust server

### Step by step
1. client send object to the server (preferably using encryption in-transit, HTTPS)
2. client encrypts object using key known only for client
3. client sent encrypted object to server and encrypted object is stored on server in encrypted form
4. when client want to download object, server sends object in encrypted form
5. client decrypts objects using key known only for client
6. client is able to see decrypted object
