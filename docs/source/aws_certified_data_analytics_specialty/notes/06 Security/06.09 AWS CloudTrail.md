# AWS CloudTrail
* provides compliance and audit for AWS account
* store every API call made to aws account, no matter what application is used (console/cli/sdk)
* as it stores API calls, it is more to verify changes in AWS objects, not in data...
* enabled by default
* can put logs from cloudtrail to cloudwatch
* shows past 90 days of activity
* default UI shows only Create/Modify/Delete events
* user can create cloudtrail trail and:
  * get a detailed list of all the events
  * store this trail in S3 (SSE-S3 automatically applied)

## Pricing model
* last 90 days visible in GUI is free of charge
* pay for created trails (1 is free) based on number of data events delivered (i.e. for data events delivered to Amazon S3, it's 0,10 USD per 100000 events delivered)
