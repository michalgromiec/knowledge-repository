# AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

* in most cases KMS is responsible for encryption in whole AWS
* fully integrated with IAM for authorization
* integrated with
  * EBS - encrypt volumes
  * S3 - server side encryption (SSE-KMS)
  * redshift, rds - encryption of data
  * ssm - parameter store
* instead of storing secrets in plaintext, you should store them as encrypted secrets
* KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
  * for bigger objects, use envelope encryption (encrypt datakey and use this encrypted datakey to encrypt objects)
* access to key is secured by
  * Key Policy (user access to key)
  * IAM Policy (access user to KMS functionalities)
* client fully manage the keys
  * create key
  * rotate key
  * disable/enable key
* audit key usage is possible using CloudTrail
* user doesn't have direct access to key (see below Step by Step instruction)

## Price model
* monthly pay for key:
  * AWS Managed Service Default CMK: free
  * User keys created in KMS: 1USD/month
  * User keys imported: 1USD/month
* pay for API call to KMS: 0,03USD/10000 calls

## Step by step
### Encryption
1. User send secret and want to encrypt it using KMS
2. KMS checks if user have proper permissions (IAM policy) and can encrypt object using this key (Key Policy)
3. If user have permissions, object is encrypted and send back to the user in ecnrypted form

### Decryption
1. If user want to decrypt object, sends this object to kms
2. KMS checks if user have proper permissions (IAM policy) and can encrypt object using this key (Key Policy)
3. If user have permissions, object is decrypted and send back to the user in plain, decrypted form

## Key rotation
### Automatic
* happens every 1 year (cannot change this period)
* only for customer-managed CMK
* previous key is kept active to be able to decrypt old data
* new key has the same CMK ID

### Manual
* can define rotation period
* new key has a different CMK ID
* client needs to keep previous keys active
* client can aliases keys so applications can use the same alias and key is changed underneath
